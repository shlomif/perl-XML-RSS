Revision history for Perl extension XML::RSS

1.10 - March 11, 2006
       - Module (for now) maintained by Ask Bjoern Hansen
       - Fixed category output in RSS 2.0 (RT#17303, Yasuhiro Onishi)
       - Update documentation with new Subversion server and bug tracking
       - Clean up distribution (tests, Makefile.PL, file locations, ...)

1.05 - Thu Aug 12 20:54:31 2004
       - fixed version number
       - improved RSS 2.0 generation support
       - typo and documentation fixes
    
1.04 - Web Mar 03 20:49:43 2004
       - update Changes to include changes for 1.03
       
1.03 - Web Mar 03 00:24:07 2004
       - quell warnings when parsing RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0
   
1.02 - Mon Feb 20 15:34:21 2003
       - fixed bug in encode().  encode() did not respect CDATA
         sections and would mangle them when encountered.  now behaves
         properly (we hope) even when CDATA and #PCDATA are mixed
         together liberally

1.01 - Mon Feb  3 15:46:25 2003
    * fixed bug with handle_char().  i (brian d foy) mis-diagnosed a
    previous bug and broke handle_char() when what I should have done
    was initialise the object for each call to parse*()

    * if you have version 1.0, you should upgrade to this version, 1.01

1.00 - Fri Jan 31 11:26:41 2003
    * the as_string method now encodes special characters. valid output!
    * a new "Auto Add" feature can add modules for namespaces found
    while parsing (off by default)
    * can output RSS 2.0, but not parse it yet
    * this is the last major release in this track.  we are going to
    completely rewrite XML::RSS as something more extendable.

0.98_05 - Mon Jan 27 15:54:32 2003
    * The auto add_feature is not controlled by the $AUTO_ADD variable
    and is off by default
    * removed the distribution tests now that it is ready to distribute

0.98_04 - Fri Jan 17 20:00:29 2003
    * the parse and parsefile routines now automatically add non-
    standard namespace to the modules list

0.98_03 - Fri Jan 17 19:22:20 2003
       * changed the handle_char() routine to replace data rather than
       append to existing data.  this takes care of the doubling problem
       in the last issue.
 
       * set the RSS 2.0 namespace in the _initializer routine
 
       * all tests now pass.  if this works for people, it could turn into
       a release candidate

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 19:15:45 2003
    * changed the handle_char() routine to replace data rather than
    append to existing data.  this takes care of the doubling problem
    in the last issue.

    * set the RSS 2.0 namespace in the _initializer routine

    * all tests now pass.  if this works for people, it could turn into
    a release candidate

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 15:47:29 2003
    * added initial RSS 2.0 support
    * first fix to properly encode special characters in output
    * need to fix feature to add namespace (tests are TO DO)

0.98 Tue Nov 12 05:45:36 CST 2002
    - module taken over by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>
    - module now in SourceForge (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/perl-rss)
    - added support for arbitrary namespaces (with defaults to the
    usual suspects)
    - fixed ommission of encoding with version 0.9 output

0.97 Wed Mar 21 03:13:29 EST 2001
    - added support for the Taxonomy module (taxo). It only works
      inside the channel or item elements and only supports one
      form of the module syntax. See the XML::RSS documentation
      for examples.      

0.96 Sat Mar 17 17:21:27 EST 2001
     - fixed RSS 0.91 output. When the source file that is parsed was
       1.0, it did not properly translate all of the dc elements to
       0.91 channel elements.

0.95 Sat Dec 23 11:28:03 EST 2000
     - added support for including external namespaces and elements

    - it no longer checks for size as specified by Netscape's RSS spec

      that contained entities. Reported by 
      Wojciech Zwiefka <wojtekz@cnt.pl>
    - prettied up the output from rss2html.pl. It's
      now more suitable for including news feeds on
      a Web site. Also added ability to give local
      filename or http URL.
